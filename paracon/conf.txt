#
# This sample file does not have examples for all of the possibilities.
# Consult the User Guide for more details on configuration options
# and other documents for more details for different uses.
#
# These are the most likely settings you might change:
#
#	(1)   	MYCALL 	-  call sign and SSID for your station.
#
#			Look for lines starting with MYCALL and
#			change NOCALL to your own.
#
#	(2)	PBEACON	-  enable position beaconing.
#
#			Look for lines starting with PBEACON and
#			modify for your call, location, etc.
#
#	(3)	DIGIPEATER  -  configure digipeating rules.
#
#			Look for lines starting with DIGIPEATER.
#			Most people will probably use the given example.
#			Just remove the "#" from the start of the line
#			to enable it.
#
#	(4)	IGSERVER, IGLOGIN  - IGate server and login
#
#			Configure an IGate client to relay messages between
#			radio and internet servers.
#
#
# The default location is "direwolf.conf" in the current working directory.
# An alternate configuration file location can be specified with the "-c" command line option.
#
# As you probably guessed by now, # indicates a comment line.
#
# Remove the # at the beginning of a line if you want to use a sample
# configuration that is currently commented out.
#
# Commands are a keyword followed by parameters.
#
# Command key words are case insensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are equivalent.
#
# Command parameters are generally case sensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are different.

# Many people will simply use the default sound device.

# When the Windows version starts up, it displays something like
# this with the available sound devices and capabilities:

# Example: To use the microphone and speaker connections on the

#ADEVICE High
ADEVICE  0 0


# Example: To use the USB Audio, use a command like this with
# the input and output device numbers.  (Remove the # comment character.)
#ADEVICE USB

# You can also use "-" or "stdin" to pipe stdout from
# some other application such as a software defined radio.
# "stdin" is not an audio device.  Don't use this unless you
# understand what this means.  Read the User Guide.
# You can also specify "UDP:" and an optional port for input.
# Something different must be specified for output.

# ADEVICE stdin 0
# ADEVICE UDP:7355 0

# The position in the list can change when devices (e.g. USB) are added and removed.
# You can also specify devices by using part of the name.
# Here is an example of specifying the USB Audio device.
# This is case-sensitive.  Upper and lower case are not treated the same.

#ADEVICE USB



#
# Number of audio channels for this souncard:  1 (mono) or 2 (stereo).

#
# The following MYCALL, MODEM, PTT, etc. configuration items
# apply to the most recent CHANNEL.
#

#
# Station identifier for this channel.
# Multiple channels can have the same or different names.
#
# It can be up to 6 letters and digits with an optional ssid.
# The APRS specification requires that it be upper case.
#
# Example (don't use this unless you are me):  MYCALL WB2OSZ-5
#

MYCALL KC3YTX

#
# Pick a suitable modem speed based on your situation.
#	1200 	Most common for VHF/UHF.  This is the default if not specified.
#	2400	QPSK compatible with MFJ-2400, and probably PK232-2400 & KPC-2400.
#	300	Low speed for HF SSB.  Default tones 1600 & 1800.
#	EAS	Emergency Alert System (EAS) Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME).
#	9600	G3RUH style - Can't use Microphone and Speaker connections.
#	AIS	International system for tracking ships on VHF.
#			Also uses 9600 bps so Speaker connection won't work.
#
# In most cases you can just specify the speed.  Examples:
#

MODEM 1200
#MODEM 9600

#
# Many options are available for great flexibility.
# See User Guide for details.
#

#
# Uncomment line below to enable the DTMF decoder for this channel.
#

#DTMF

# Push to Talk (PTT) can be confusing because there are so many different cases.
# Radio-Interface-Guide.pdf  in  https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf-doc
# goes into detail about the various options.

# If using a C-Media CM108/CM119 or similar USB Audio Adapter,
# you can use a GPIO pin for PTT control. This is very convenient
# because a single USB connection is used for both audio and PTT.
# Example:

#PTT CM108
#
# The transmitter Push to Talk (PTT) control can be wired to a serial port
# with a suitable interface circuit.  DON'T connect it directly!
#
# For the PTT command, specify the device and either RTS or DTR.
# RTS or DTR may be preceded by "-" to invert the signal.
# Both can be used for interfaces that want them driven with opposite polarity.
#

PTT COM7 RTS
#PTT COM1 RTS -DTR

# The Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal can be sent to most of the same places
# as the PTT signal.  This could be used to light up an LED like a normal TNC.

#DCD COM1 -DTR

# Dire Wolf acts as a virtual TNC and can communicate with
# client applications by different protocols:
#
#	- the "AGW TCPIP Socket Interface" - default port 8000
#	- KISS protocol over TCP socket - default port 8001
#	- KISS TNC via serial port
#

AGWPORT 8000
KISSPORT 8001

#
# Some applications are designed to operate with only a physical
# TNC attached to a serial port.  For these, we provide a virtual serial
# port that appears to be connected to a TNC.
#
# Take a look at the User Guide for instructions to set up
# two virtual serial ports named COM3 and COM4 connected by
# a null modem.
#
# Using the  configuration described, Dire Wolf will connect to
# COM3 and the client application will use COM4.
#
# Uncomment following line to use this feature.

# First you need to specify the name of a Tier 2 server.
# The current preferred way is to use one of these regional rotate addresses:

#	noam.aprs2.net 		- for North America
#	soam.aprs2.net		- for South America
#	euro.aprs2.net		- for Europe and Africa
#	asia.aprs2.net 		- for Asia
#	aunz.aprs2.net		- for Oceania

#IGSERVER noam.aprs2.net

# You also need to specify your login name and passcode.
# Contact the author if you can't figure out how to generate the passcode.

#IGLOGIN WB2OSZ-5 123456

# That's all you need for a receive only IGate which relays
# messages from the local radio channel to the global servers.

# Some might want to send an IGate client position directly to a server
# without sending it over the air and relying on someone else to
# forward it to an IGate server.  This is done by using sendto=IG rather
# than a radio channel number. Overlay R for receive only, T for two way.
# There is no need to send it as often as you would over the radio.

#PBEACON sendto=IG delay=0:30 every=60:00 symbol="igate" overlay=R lat=42^37.14N long=071^20.83W
#PBEACON sendto=IG delay=0:30 every=60:00 symbol="igate" overlay=T lat=42^37.14N long=071^20.83W


# To relay messages from the Internet to radio, you need to add
# one more option with the transmit channel number and a VIA path.

#IGTXVIA 0 WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1


# Finally, we don't want to flood the radio channel.
# The IGate function will limit the number of packets transmitted
# during 1 minute and 5 minute intervals.   If a limit would
# be exceeded, the packet is dropped and message is displayed in red.
# This might be low for APRS Thursday when there is abnormally high activity.
